# This-Bucket

Always tired, always tired beacuse, the weight,
this bucket has, and each time it overflows, and i empty it
a new flood creates.
Each time I empty it it fills up so quickly, and
i wish i had an answer to why it happens, but i don't.
So from now on, i'll poke holes throught my bucket,
so whanever it starts filling, it drips, in order to
never create a flood again.
It was so hard for me to imagine the weight of other's
people bucket, beacuse i've always been focused on carrying
mine with it's wheight.
But now that mine has holes, it got a lot lighter.
Then suddenly, my country got flooded, and it was
beacuse someone emptied their bucket.
"WOW"
I realized, that i'm not the only one that carries this much
weight.
I've seen what the flood does, it destroys everithing in it's way.
I don't wanna be responsible for another flood that i create,
so with my knife, i'll poke holes on mine, so i never destroy
anyone country's again, and it'll be better for me,
beacuse i'll never have to carry this much weight again.
